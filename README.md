## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to enhance our group project #1, by incorporating new features that allow refinements such as allergy specifications, diet preferences and ability to save user information and receipes.

We utilized our goals that we initially set 4 months ago as our inspiration to improve work we had already created. This allowed for reflection on growth and skill level obtained over these previous 4 months, as well as provided an opportunity to dive deeper into a creative realm of developing a useful application. 

### Challenges: 
- Schedules (different time zones, life, work)

### Successes: 
- Effective Communication 


## Objectives
```md
GIVEN I am allergic to certain foods
WHEN I input my preferred categories
THEN I will find recipes that contain the listed specifications. 

GIVEN that I want to save my user information 
WHEN I want to reference previously searched/saved receipes
THEN I am able to create a new user with saved data being encrypted

GIVEN that I want to plan my weekly calendar
THEN I am able to save receipes for different days of the week.
```
## User Story 

Healthy Helper Version 2.0 seeks to help enhance the audience base by incorporating new categorization features to specifiy diet restirictions or food alleriges. 

New features also include ability to save user information such as first and last name and email to allow opportunity to share future company deals or promotions.

Additionally, the latest updates allow for the user to plan weeekly meals, with ingredient list and nutritional values incorporated.


### **Additional Criteria**
