# Healthy Helper 2.0

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to enhance our group project #1, by incorporating new features that allow refinements such as diet restrictions and preferences, ability to save user information, and overall provide a more cohesive User Experience.

We utilized our goals that we initially set 4 months ago as our inspiration to improve the work we had already started. This allowed for reflection on growth and skill level obtained since then, as well as provided an opportunity to dive deeper into the creative realm of developing a useful application.

### Challenges: 
- Schedules (different time zones, life, work)

### Successes: 
- Effective Communication 
- Git Merges and Conflict Resolution

## Objectives
```
GIVEN I am allergic to certain foods
WHEN I input my preferred categories
THEN I will find recipes that contain the listed specifications. 

GIVEN that I want to save my user information 
WHEN I want to reference previously searched/saved receipes
THEN I am able to create a new user with saved data being encrypted

GIVEN that I want to plan my weekly calendar
THEN I am able to save receipes for different days of the week.
```
## Project Update

Healthy Helper Version 2.0 seeks to help enhance the audience base by incorporating new categorization features such as:

Users may now create an account to save, or "favorite" a recipe and assign it to a meal time during the week (ie. assign a "favorited" salad recipe for lunch on Wednesday.)

Users can now seamlessly toggle macro-nutrient data by the click of a button instead of having to look up this information in a separate search bar.

Filter queries by the following Diet Types:
- Balanced
- High protein
- Low Carb
- Low Fat
- Vegan
- Vegetarian

Including Diet Types, users can also add additional filter queries by Diet Restrictions:
- Sugar-Conscious
- Peanut-Free
- Tree-Nut Free
- Alcohol Free
- Kosher

WIP/MVP Features:
Save recipe (planned)
- Assign recipe for which meal on any day of the week
- Send automated list of the required ingredients to the user's phone.
